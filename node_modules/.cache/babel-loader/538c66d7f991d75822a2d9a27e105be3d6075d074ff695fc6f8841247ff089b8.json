New materials need to be innovated, but the process of doing so manually in labs becomes extremely expensive and time-intensive. This paper explores advanced machine learning models, including specialized Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks and Variational Graph Autoencoders (VGAE), to create new molecular structures, trained on a dataset of various existing molecules and their corresponding biodegradability information. These models will be able to generate new molecular structures that can be used for materials that are stable and possess qualities that are more environmentally safe. Code for our project can be found at https://github.com/Nathan-Wang23/MLC_Final_Project. \\n\\n Our research focused on the prediction and generation of biodegradable molecules using advanced generative and classification models. By leveraging a Relational Graph Convolutional Network (RGCN) architecture, our Biodegradability model achieved a balanced accuracy of 0.8478, surpassing the state-of-the-art Generalized Convolutional Network (GCN) model, which scored 0.84 across the same dataset. This improvement demonstrates our model's precision and specificity, crucial for robustly and accurately predicting biodegradability in molecules​​ given just the chemical structures.\\n\\nWe conducted extensive experiments and latent space conditioning to refine both our WGAN and VGAE models. Our primary metrics for evaluation included validity, novelty, and uniqueness of the generated molecules. Initial experiments highlighted challenges in generating molecules with an appropriate atom count, leading to adjustments in the loss regularizer to balance molecular complexity and generation validity. These experiments resulted in a notable uniqueness increase from 30% to 61%, maintained a 70% validity rate and 88% novelty rate, but further improvements are needed to enhance overall validity and biodegradability​ of generation through better feature conditioning in the latent space.

For non-Amazonians or those not signed up for our application, it outputs a red bounding box. Users can then save, scroll through past image searches, and email Amazon aliases a copy of the image they are a part of.\",\n      paper: \"https://github.com/Nathan-Wang23/face2alias_aws\",\n      img: \"project_images/Face2Alias/face2alias_final.png\",\n      imgLarge: [\"project_images/Face2Alias/face2alias_large.png\"],\n      movie: \"ONE\",\n      other: \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      index: \"8\",\n      title: \"YouTube To Spotify Web Application\",\n      description: \"While I was a member of the Georgia Tech Web Development Club, I worked on a variety of projects, my favorite being a YouTube to Spotify playlist converter application.

I first created a data visualization web application to view the top games played around the world. Then, I got more inspired and created a GPS-capable mobile application that is an escape room through the city of Berlin. Without spoiling the plot of the game, the gist of it is that you are an agent for United States in West Berlin while the Berlin wall was up. You have until sunset (calculated using a real-time API) to 'sneak' to East Berlin to gather news about a fellow agent and any immediate bomb threats. The game provides clues and GPS mapping as the player wanders the city to locate and solve puzzles that will provide codes to move on to the next clue.\\n\\nThis GeoLocation version of an escape room allows users to exercise more, provides a fun, interesting backstory and game while exploring Berlin, and includes some historical facts.\\n\\nThis game was exciting and fun for me to create, since I had to wander throughout Berlin, look for historical and memorable landmarks, and think of clues that will point the players to the next stop.

Additionally, we have a TikTok-esque feed where a daily feed appears for users based on their top artists and recently liked songs on Spotify. We use the YouTube API endpoint to search and return covers, amateur renditions, and sheet notes for guitar and piano of popular songs the user enjoys listening to.\\n\\nThe main draw of our application is the music news tab. Many people have mentioned that their source for news relating to music, whether it comes from Instagram, Google, or TikTok, is cluttered with the other topics they're interested in. Our application, Musify, is a niche news application that allows users to be notified when their favorite artists drop a new album or are performing nearby. We use a real-time concert API, and so when an entry contains a link to purchase tickets, we provide users with a description of the concert venue, ticket prices, and where to buy.\\n\\nAs we developed this app, we performed a comprehensive domain and use case analysis, utilized Blue/Green deployment with user surveys, and created Value Proposition and Business Model Canvases. In this way, we treated our idea as a potential start up operation and focused on building up all aspects of a successful business, including good design documentation and learning how to pitch our idea to potential users.\\n\\nIn terms of development, I implemented our frontend with React Native, incorporated AWS IAM Cognito for secure user logins, attached our SQL database to our backend for user information, and fully developed the backend algorithms to choose and display a user's top artist news and videos.

Then, I did the same for another slightly transposed or image where the camera was moved and calculated the points closest to each point to the ratio of the second closest point. In this way, we could map positions of key corner points and determine how the image shifted.

New materials need to be innovated, but the process of doing so manually in labs becomes extremely expensive and time-intensive. This paper explores advanced machine learning models, including specialized Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks and Variational Graph Autoencoders (VGAE), to create new molecular structures, trained on a dataset of various existing molecules and their corresponding biodegradability information. These models will be able to generate new molecular structures that can be used for materials that are stable and possess qualities that are more environmentally safe. Code for our project can be found at https://github.com/Nathan-Wang23/MLC_Final_Project. \\n\\n Our research focused on the prediction and generation of biodegradable molecules using advanced generative and classification models. By leveraging a Relational Graph Convolutional Network (RGCN) architecture, our Biodegradability model achieved a balanced accuracy of 0.8478, surpassing the state-of-the-art Generalized Convolutional Network (GCN) model, which scored 0.84 across the same dataset. This improvement demonstrates our model's precision and specificity, crucial for robustly and accurately predicting biodegradability in molecules​​ given just the chemical structures.\\n\\nWe conducted extensive experiments and latent space conditioning to refine both our WGAN and VGAE models. Our primary metrics for evaluation included validity, novelty, and uniqueness of the generated molecules. Initial experiments highlighted challenges in generating molecules with an appropriate atom count, leading to adjustments in the loss regularizer to balance molecular complexity and generation validity. These experiments resulted in a notable uniqueness increase from 30% to 61%, maintained a 70% validity rate and 88% novelty rate, but further improvements are needed to enhance overall validity and biodegradability​ of generation through better feature conditioning in the latent space. More specifically, we want to explore the possibility of using distance based or extended connectivity fingerprints featurizers, as well as measuring electron density with a Gaussian Multipole featurizer.\",\n    paper: \"project_images/MLC/VGAE.pdf\",\n    img: [\"project_images/MLC/abstract_mlc.png\"],\n    imgLarge: [\"project_images/MLC/abstract_mlc_large.png\"],\n    movie: \"ONE\",\n    other: \"https://github.com/Nathan-Wang23/MLC_Final_Project\"\n  }\n  ];\n\n"],"mappings":"AAAA,OAAO,MAAMA,QAAQ,GAAG,CACpB;EACEC,KAAK,EAAE,GAAG;EACVC,KAAK,EAAE,iDAAiD;EACxDC,WAAW,EAAE,ypCAAypC;EACtqCC,KAAK,EAAE,kCAAkC;EACzCC,GAAG,EAAE,CAAC,qCAAqC,EAAE,iCAAiC,CAAC;EAC/EC,QAAQ,EAAE,CAAC,2CAA2C,EAAE,uCAAuC,CAAC;EAChGC,KAAK,EAAE,EAAE;EACTC,KAAK,EAAE;AACT,CAAC,EACD;EACEP,KAAK,EAAE,GAAG;EACVC,KAAK,EAAE,2CAA2C;EACpDC,WAAW,EAAE,y+CAAy+C;EACp/CC,KAAK,EAAE,kCAAkC;EACzCC,GAAG,EAAE,CAAC,sCAAsC,EAAE,0CAA0C,EAAE,oCAAoC,CAAC;EAC/HC,QAAQ,EAAE,CAAC,4CAA4C,EAAE,gDAAgD,EAAE,0CAA0C,CAAC;EACtJC,KAAK,EAAE,EAAE;EACTC,KAAK,EAAE;AACT,CAAC,EACD;EACEP,KAAK,EAAE,GAAG;EACVC,KAAK,EAAE,sEAAsE;EAC7EC,WAAW,EAAE,kgCAAkgC;EAC/gCC,KAAK,EAAE,qEAAqE;EAC5EC,GAAG,EAAE,EAAE;EACPE,KAAK,EAAE,8CAA8C;EACrDC,KAAK,EAAE;AACT,CAAC,EACD;EACEP,KAAK,EAAE,GAAG;EACVC,KAAK,EAAE,wCAAwC;EAC/CC,WAAW,EAAE,mgBAAmgB;EAChhBC,KAAK,EAAE,sDAAsD;EAC7DC,GAAG,EAAE,CAAC,kCAAkC,CAAC;EACzCC,QAAQ,EAAE,CAAC,wCAAwC,CAAC;EACpDC,KAAK,EAAE,EAAE;EACTC,KAAK,EAAE;AACT,CAAC,EACD;EACEP,KAAK,EAAE,GAAG;EACVC,KAAK,EAAE,yBAAyB;EAChCC,WAAW,EAAE,6xBAA6xB;EAC1yBC,KAAK,EAAE,yDAAyD;EAChEC,GAAG,EAAE,CAAC,oCAAoC,CAAC;EAC3CE,KAAK,EAAE,uCAAuC;EAC9CC,KAAK,EAAE;AACT,CAAC,EACD;EACEP,KAAK,EAAE,GAAG;EACVC,KAAK,EAAE,4CAA4C;EACnDC,WAAW,EAAE,4oGAA4oG;EACzpGC,KAAK,EAAE,4CAA4C;EACnDC,GAAG,EAAE,kDAAkD;EACvDE,KAAK,EAAE,KAAK;EACZC,KAAK,EAAE;AACT,CAAC,EACD;EACEP,KAAK,EAAE,GAAG;EACVC,KAAK,EAAE,wBAAwB;EAC/BC,WAAW,EAAE,opCAAopC;EACjqCC,KAAK,EAAE,iDAAiD;EACxDC,GAAG,EAAE,gDAAgD;EACrDC,QAAQ,EAAE,CAAC,gDAAgD,CAAC;EAC5DC,KAAK,EAAE,KAAK;EACZC,KAAK,EAAE;AACT,CAAC,EACD;EACEP,KAAK,EAAE,GAAG;EACVC,KAAK,EAAE,oCAAoC;EAC3CC,WAAW,EAAE,oxBAAoxB;EACjyBC,KAAK,EAAE,8CAA8C;EACrDC,GAAG,EAAE,iDAAiD;EACtDC,QAAQ,EAAE,CAAC,wDAAwD,CAAC;EACpEC,KAAK,EAAE,KAAK;EACZC,KAAK,EAAE;AACT,CAAC,EACD;EACEP,KAAK,EAAE,GAAG;EACVC,KAAK,EAAE,yBAAyB;EAChCC,WAAW,EAAE,suCAAsuC;EACnvCC,KAAK,EAAE,2DAA2D;EAClEC,GAAG,EAAE,kDAAkD;EACvDC,QAAQ,EAAE,kDAAkD;EAC5DC,KAAK,EAAE,KAAK;EACZC,KAAK,EAAE;AACT,CAAC,EACD;EACEP,KAAK,EAAE,IAAI;EACXC,KAAK,EAAE,8BAA8B;EACrCC,WAAW,EAAE,+/DAA+/D;EAC5gEC,KAAK,EAAE,0CAA0C;EACjDC,GAAG,EAAE,CAAC,kCAAkC,EAAE,yCAAyC,CAAC;EACpFC,QAAQ,EAAE,CAAC,wCAAwC,EAAE,+CAA+C,CAAC;EACrGC,KAAK,EAAE,EAAE;EACTC,KAAK,EAAE;AACT,CAAC,EACD;EACEP,KAAK,EAAE,IAAI;EACXC,KAAK,EAAE,iCAAiC;EACxCC,WAAW,EAAE,yuBAAyuB;EACtvBC,KAAK,EAAE,0DAA0D;EACjEC,GAAG,EAAE,6CAA6C;EAClDC,QAAQ,EAAE,CAAC,4CAA4C,EAAE,gDAAgD,EAAE,+CAA+C,CAAC;EAC3JC,KAAK,EAAE,KAAK;EACZC,KAAK,EAAE;AACT,CAAC,EACD;EACEP,KAAK,EAAE,IAAI;EACXC,KAAK,EAAE,iDAAiD;EACxDC,WAAW,EAAE,6xBAA6xB;EAC1yBC,KAAK,EAAE,EAAE;EACTC,GAAG,EAAE,oDAAoD;EACzDC,QAAQ,EAAE,CAAC,gEAAgE,EAAE,8DAA8D,CAAC;EAC5IC,KAAK,EAAE,KAAK;EACZC,KAAK,EAAE;AACV,CAAC,EACD;EACCP,KAAK,EAAE,IAAI;EACXC,KAAK,EAAE,8FAA8F;EACrGC,WAAW,EAAE,0zEAA0zE;EACv0EC,KAAK,EAAE,6BAA6B;EACpCC,GAAG,EAAE,CAAC,qCAAqC,CAAC;EAC5CC,QAAQ,EAAE,CAAC,2CAA2C,CAAC;EACvDC,KAAK,EAAE,KAAK;EACZC,KAAK,EAAE;AACT,CAAC,CACA"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
